## Intuition
The problem is asking for the length of the longest valid parentheses substring. A valid parentheses string is one where every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket. We can use a stack to keep track of the indices of the invalid parentheses.
â€‹
## Approach
- Initialize a stack with -1 to handle edge cases where the entire string is a valid parentheses string.
- Iterate over the string. If an opening bracket is encountered, push its index onto the stack.
- If a closing bracket is encountered, pop an element from the stack. This signifies that a valid pair has been found.
- Check if the stack is empty. If it is, push the current index onto the stack. If it's not, calculate the length of the valid parentheses string by subtracting the top of the stack from the current index.
- Update the maximum length if the current length is greater than the maximum length.
Return the maximum length.
## Complexity
- Time complexity: The time complexity is O(n) because we are iterating over the string once.
- Space complexity: The space complexity is O(n) because in the worst case, if the string consists of all opening brackets, we will push all the indices onto the stack.
